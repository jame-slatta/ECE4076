    "## Lab 2: Image Stitching with Homographies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore image stitching and panorama creation. You will use a homography to register two images together, and implement bilinear interpolation to help accomplish this. As part of the lab, you will also explore image enhancement strategies to improve the quality of image stitching at the seam (the join between two images) relying on your knowledge of image brightness and human perception of this. Collectively, tasks 1-5 will provide a final stitched image. In task 6, you will apply the same code written in tasks 1-5 to create a panorama image using your own photos.\n",
